# About this demo
Nowadays, most of the application start from a framework/library, and think of how to implement the application with the specific framework/library. Lots of tutorials/boilerplate projects teach you how to code with a specific framework/library. With this approach, your code is tightly binded to a special framework.

In this demo app, I will show you that a few lines of code (â‰ˆ160) can help you make your application independent to the framework/library.

For example: this simple counter app, is implemented with 5 different ways/frameworks/libraries (vanillar javascript, react, angular2, vue.js, and d3), and they share the same application logic and state. It makes you easily write reusable, framework/library-independent code, so that you can easily change the underlying implementation from one library to another to adapt to your business needs.
